# 🌿 Plant Disease Recognition using Deep Learning

This project uses machine learning and deep learning techniques to detect plant diseases from leaf images. It includes trained models and a web app interface built using Streamlit.

> ✅ **Note:** Model files (`.h5`, `.pkl`, `.keras`) are tracked using **Git LFS**. Make sure you have Git LFS installed before cloning the repo.
